Run the following commands for the provisioning of AWS Infrastructure:

1) terraform init 
   (Initializes the working directory by downloading necessary provider plugins and setting up the backend for Terraform)

2) terraform validate
   (Checks the syntax and configuration of the Terraform files for correctness, ensuring no errors before applying changes)

3) terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
   (Creates an execution plan by comparing the current state of the infrastructure with the desired configuration, showing the changes that will be made)

4) terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
   (Applies the changes defined in the execution plan to the infrastructure, provisioning or modifying resources as necessary)
